# Source material For CyberGym 3.0

CyberGym is a [Lucidues](https://www.lucideus.com) internal CTF for the hackers to learn and practice something new.

We use [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/) as our platform to host our CTF.

All the challenges that require a network connection are running on top of Docker.

You can install docker on your system with a convenient script:
``` bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh -

```
Add your user to docker group for convenient management
``` bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Writeups are available [here]()

The challenges are organized in to various categories and are easy to setup and practice.
